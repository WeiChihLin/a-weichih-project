# a-weichih-project

Author: WeiChihLin

This project is an example of calculating the probability of loss for toss n time coins.

## Getting Started
Clone this repo and its modules by running.
```
https://github.com/WeiChihLin/a-weichih-project.git
```

### Prerequisites
The framework has been developed and tested under Ubuntu 18.04. The requirement packages are as the following.
Requirements:
* python 3.7.11
* scipy  1.5.2
* numpy  1.19.1
* pytest 6.1.1
This project has been build by the anaconda. Please use the anaconda to build the environment with requirement.txt to run this project.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
cd a-weichih-project
conda install --file requirement.txt
```
The main file locates at calcuate_probability. The function can execute as the following command.
```
python main.py -n 30
```
n is the times toss the coins and the output is the probability of loss.

## Running the tests

This project uses the pytest to test the main function.
The test file locates at test/item_1 named test_this.py.


### Coding style tests
